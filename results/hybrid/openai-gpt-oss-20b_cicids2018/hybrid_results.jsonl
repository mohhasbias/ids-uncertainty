All packets carry only the ACK flag and no payload, indicating an attempt to overwhelm the target with acknowledgment packets rather than meaningful HTTP requests. The extremely short duration (0.00s) and sub\u2011millisecond inter\u2011arrival time further suggest a burst of automated packets typical of a denial\u2011of\u2011service attack. While some legitimate network tests or keep\u2011alive traffic can produce short bursts, the combination of zero\u2011length packets, ACK\u2011only flags, and port 80 strongly aligns with known ACK\u2011flood tactics used by threat actors.
